### Why?
  
  Existing stores work fine but we needed a store that supports replica sets configuration passed to it.

## Installation

connect-mongostore supports connect `>= 1.0.3`, express `3.x` and express `4.x` with express-session.

via npm:

    $ npm install connect-mongostore

## Options

  Pass a fully-qualified URI as the only option (e.g., `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/myDatabase`), or an object (also see `examples` folder for configuration examples):

  - `db` Can be three different things:
    - database name (string)
    - mongo-native database instance
    - object with replica set options. These options requires:
    
      + `name` Database name
      + `servers` Array of replica set server configurations similar to:

          ```javascript
            {
              "host" : "127.0.0.1", // required
              "port" : 27017, // required
              "options" : { // all optional
                "autoReconnect" : false,
                "poolSize" : 200,
                "socketOptions" : {
                  "timeout" : 0,
                  "noDelay" : true,
                  "keepAlive" : 1,
                  "encoding" : "utf8"
                }
              }
            }
          ```
          Configuration options explained [here](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-generated/server.html)
      + `replicaSetOptions` An object with a single `rs_name` property specifying your replica set name
  - `collection` Collection (optional, default: `sessions`) 
  - `host` MongoDB server hostname (optional, default: `127.0.0.1`). Not needed for Replica Sets.
  - `port` MongoDB server port (optional, default: `27017`) Not needed for Replica Sets.
  - `username` Username (optional)
  - `password` Password (optional)
  - `authSource` Options for `Db#authenticate` method (optional)
  - `expireAfter` Duration of session cookies in milliseconds (e.g., ones with `maxAge` not defined). Defaults to 2 weeks.
    May be useful if you see a lot of orphaned sessions in the database and want them removed sooner than 2 weeks.
  - `autoReconnect` This is passed directly to the MongoDB `Server` constructor as the auto_reconnect
                     option (optional, default: false).
  - `ssl` Use SSL to connect to MongoDB (optional, default: false).
  - `mongooseConnection` in the form: `mongooseDatabase.connections[0]` to use an existing mongoose connection. (optional)
  - `stringify` If false, connect-mongostore will serialize sessions using `JSON.stringify` before
                setting them, and deserialize them with `JSON.parse` when getting them.
                (optional, default: false). Note that deserialization will not revive Dates, Object IDs and other non-plain objects.

## Example

With express 3.x:

    var express = require('express');
    var MongoStore = require('connect-mongostore')(express);
    var app = express();
    
    app.use(express.session({
        secret: 'my secret',
        store: new MongoStore({'db': 'sessions'})
      }));

With express 4.x:

    var express = require('express');
    var session = require('express-session');
    var MongoStore = require('connect-mongostore')(session);
    var app = express();

    app.use(session({
        secret: 'my secret',
        store: new MongoStore({'db': 'sessions'})
      }));

With connect:

    var connect = require('connect');
    var MongoStore = require('connect-mongostore')(connect);

## Removing expired sessions

  connect-mongostore uses MongoDB's TTL collection feature (2.2+) to
  have mongod automatically remove expired sessions. (mongod runs this
  check every minute.)

  **Note:** By connect/express's default, session cookies are set to 
  expire when the user closes their browser (maxAge: null). In accordance
  with standard industry practices, connect-mongostore will set these sessions
  to expire two weeks from their last 'set'. You can override this 
  behavior by manually setting the maxAge for your cookies - just keep in
  mind that any value less than 60 seconds is pointless, as mongod will
  only delete expired documents in a TTL collection every minute.

  For more information, consult connect's [session documentation](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/session.html).

## Tests

You need `mocha`.

    make test

The tests use a database called `connect-mongostore-test`. `make test` **does not** run replica set tests.

To run all tests including replica set tests:

    make test-rs

Note that replica set tests will fail unless you 1) have a replica set, and 2) set the address of that replica set either in `CM_REPL_SET_HOST` environment variable or directly in `connect-mongostore.test.js` file.

You can check code coverage report by running

    make coverage
    
or
    
    make coverage-rs
        
for coverage with replica set tests.
    
Coverage report will be in `reports/lcov-report/index.html` file.


## Stuff

Big thanks to @kcbanner and his `connect-mongo`, which was a starting point for `connect-mongostore`.
